# two-sticks
arduino codes for a two stick interaction design study

HARDWARE
-input: a flex sensor grounded through a 100Ohm resistor
-output: two servo motor HS422 powered by the Arduino and attached to pin2, pin4

test_3 is the first stable version, but it is boring
test_5 is the curios/interactive behavior
test_6 is the angry/protective behavior
